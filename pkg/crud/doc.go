// Package CRUD is meant to make two things: map structs to PostgreSQL tables (like ORM) and create CRUD HTTP
// endpoint for simple data management.
//
// HTTP endpoint can be set to allow creating, updating, removing new object, along with returning its details,
// or list of objects. All requests and responses are in the JSON format.
//
// Please follow GitHub page for an example:
// https://github.com/streamln/crud/pkg/crud
package crud
